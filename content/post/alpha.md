## Maybe a cute little burb about something else...

Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good!

Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Brave heart, Clara. Goodbye, Clara. No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. Geronimo! Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.

## Something Else Awesome

No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. You are the only mystery worth solving. Brave heart, Clara. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Come along, Pond! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff. Geronimo! I never know why. I only know who.

Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know.
